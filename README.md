# Introduction
This is a pytorch implementation for paper [ADNet](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9927333) (TMM2022). ADNet is a shrunk polygon-based scene text detector, which uses an instance-wise dilation factor to obtain more complete and tight results. This repository is built on [DBNet](https://github.com/MhLiao/DB).
